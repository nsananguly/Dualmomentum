# Dual momentum:
I have been very keen to get my hands on Dual Momentum investing and have learnt a lot from Gary Anntonaci,Wisley Grey,Mark Minervini. This is an attempt to build and test strategies on ETF data. The reason I have to chosen ETF is for low cost and it covers the larger universe of stocks.
I intend to use Backtesting and Backtrader libraries to test my strategy.
